# ebay_auto

This project employs the used cars data set from eBay "Kleinanzeigen", a classifieds section of the German eBay website. The goal of this project is to clean the data and analyze the used car listing by filtering, grouping and computing statistics and plots using general python and pandas techniques. Several functions, for loops and method chains are created. Pandas methods like groupby, hierarchial indexing and concatenate are applied. Visualization is done with matplotlib or the pandas implementation of matplotlib.
Insights and result are written below in the comments and markdown cells.
